    description:
      "In 2024, I developed a price monitoring system that scraped product data from various e-commerce websites using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Selenium. I integrated Celery and Redis for background task processing, enabling periodic and real-time price tracking. The data was stored in a database for detailed competitor price analysis. This provided valuable insights into market trends and pricing strategies.",
